Approval style tests are currently off-line because their post-run
 .txt file retrieval is not trivial on a docker swarm solution
which is what we are currently working towards.

Once a docker-swarm solution is in place we can investigate
how to re-instate Approval style tests, possibly by pushing
changes inside the docker-container back to the git-server
and then pulling those back to the cyber-dojo server.
