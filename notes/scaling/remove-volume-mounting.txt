TODO: why does bottom of http://blog.cyber-dojo.org/2015/01/setting-up-your-own-digital-ocean-cyber.html
      says to update the caches and then chown the cache?
      why doesn't the command do the chown itself?
      blog should simply say to do this...
      $ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo/languages
      $ ./refresh_cache.rb
      $ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo/exercises
      $ ./refresh_cache.rb

TODO: pull.sh echo says
>echo "git pulling from https://github.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo"
And that wasn't true in this case
