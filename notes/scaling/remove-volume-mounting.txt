Notes on trying Byran's branch on my digital-ocean test server
to test out converting cyberdojo/X docker images to cyberdojofoundation/X
images that do not require a volume-mount.
First step in moving to stateless docker swarm architecture
===============================================================

Worked fine. docker-container upgrade on cyber-dojo.org complete.

Notes.

TODO: Check that ENV vars are set in test_wrapper.sh
TODO: rename languages/cache.rb to refresh_cache.rb
      also mentioned at bottom of admin_scripts/docker_pull_all.rb
      also mentioned at bottom of http://blog.cyber-dojo.org/2015/01/setting-up-your-own-digital-ocean-cyber.html
      
TODO: rename exercises/cache.rb to refresh_cache.rb 
      also mentioned at bottom of http://blog.cyber-dojo.org/2015/01/setting-up-your-own-digital-ocean-cyber.html

TODO: why does bottom of http://blog.cyber-dojo.org/2015/01/setting-up-your-own-digital-ocean-cyber.html
      says to update the caches and then chown the cache?
      why doesn't the command do the chown itself?
      blog should simply say to do this...
      $ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo/languages
      $ ./refresh_cache.rb
      $ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo/exercises
      $ ./refresh_cache.rb

TODO: pull.sh echo says
>echo "git pulling from https://github.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo"
And that wasn't true in this case
